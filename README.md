# 🤖 Humanoid Robot OOP Project

## 📌 Overview
This project is a Python-based **Object-Oriented (OOP) system** for a humanoid robot, designed to perform the following key operations:
- **Movement**: Move **forward** and **backward** while checking for obstacles.
- **Object Interaction**: **Pick up** and **drop objects** while ensuring only one object is held at a time.
- **Battery Management**: Monitor battery level and **recharge** when required.
- **Task Logging & Undo**: Tasks are managed using **Lists, Stacks (LIFO), and Queues (FIFO).**
- **Shutdown Functionality**: The robot can be powered off.

## 📌 Features
✔ **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** for user interaction  
✔ **OOP-based modular structure**  
✔ **Error handling for battery, movement, and obstacles**  
✔ **Task logging and undo operations**  
✔ **GitHub repository for submission compliance**
